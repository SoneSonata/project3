1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.567
<v ->Alexander had a great idea.</v>

2
00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:02.400
(both chuckle)

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.020
<v ->Okay, in your opinion.</v>

4
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.240
Okay, this is just in her opinion, it was great.

5
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.190
<v ->It was also not my idea, in case you don't like it,</v>

6
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.200
it was all his.
<v ->Yes, it was.</v>

7
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.720
And if you loved it, it was also all my idea.

8
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.460
So only praise can go to me

9
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.900
but also only hate can go to me,

10
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.700
so-
<v ->That's how I like it.</v>

11
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.250
Alexander had a great idea to do,

12
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.260
'cause we got so many emails from you all

13
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.380
and we just, we were already on a subway roll

14
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.880
with the first subway stations, then Subway sandwiches.

15
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.310
And Alexander said, "why don't we do an episode

16
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.060
where we play a fun guessing game of

17
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.100
is it a subway or is it a Subway?"

18
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.830
And we gotta guess if the other person's review

19
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.220
is of a subway station or a Subway sandwich shop.

20
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.810
<v ->So stupid.</v>
<v ->And I don't know</v>

21
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.920
if I did it right, I feel like, I don't know,

22
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.850
I don't know, we'll see,

23
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.710
we'll see.
<v ->I don't know either-</v>

24
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.059
<v ->We've never done this before,</v>

25
00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.320
obviously.
<v ->This is really weird</v>

26
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.880
and strange, but-
<v ->That's why</v>

27
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.190
it's a holiday special.

28
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.670
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->So,</v>

29
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.400
I think you have several more than I do

30
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.660
or at least a couple more.

31
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.210
<v ->Yeah, here's, I'll give you my first one.</v>

32
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.070
<v ->I labeled mine Subway number two,</v>

33
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.301
which I guess technically would be number three.

34
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:12.303
<v ->Yeah, this is our third-</v>
<v ->What is wrong with us?</v>

35
00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:15.660
<v ->week in a row that we're doing something subway related,</v>

36
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.060
this time combining the two.

37
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.503
Here's my first one, this is a one star review by Paul.

38
00:01:23.887 --> 00:01:26.670
"Horrid experience, the line is wrapped

39
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.270
back and forth inside, out the door and down the road,

40
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.480
45 minutes so far, and not even close to the counter.

41
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.900
Incompetent management, unacceptable."

42
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.245
End of review.

43
00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:41.460
<v ->Wow.</v>
<v ->Pretty ambiguous, huh?</v>

44
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.293
What could it be?

45
00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:43.815
Everyone, you can play at home as well.

46
00:01:43.815 --> 00:01:44.648
(Christine laughing)

47
00:01:44.648 --> 00:01:45.540
I don't know how-

48
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.190
<v ->You're allowed to play at home.</v>

49
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.210
<v ->We're allowing it.</v>

50
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.580
<v ->We'll give you permission.</v>
<v ->Find a friend</v>

51
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.200
to play this with.
<v ->No, you're at Thanksgiving,</v>

52
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.797
turn up the volume.
(Alexander laughs)

53
00:01:53.797 --> 00:01:54.657
<v ->Oh, play this.</v>
<v ->Get your drunk uncle</v>

54
00:01:54.657 --> 00:01:56.323
in on it.
<v ->Oh no. (Christine chuckles)</v>

55
00:01:56.323 --> 00:01:57.156
Oh no.

56
00:01:57.156 --> 00:01:58.110
<v ->All those people you've been saying</v>

57
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.820
I love this podcast.
<v ->Oh God.</v>

58
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.890
<v ->They can finally participate.</v>

59
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.120
My guess is that this is a Subway sandwich.

60
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.957
<v ->No.</v>

61
00:02:06.957 --> 00:02:07.830
<v ->No?</v>
<v ->It's not,</v>

62
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.000
this is of the LAX Aviation Station,

63
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.670
the metro stop for LAX.
(Christine giggles)

64
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.916
<v ->You know what?, I should have gotten it when,</v>

65
00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:18.127
'cause I thought to myself,

66
00:02:18.127 --> 00:02:20.520
"why would anyone wait so long in a line

67
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.620
for a Subway sandwich?"
<v ->Yep.</v>

68
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.790
<v ->You would just-</v>
<v ->True.</v>

69
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.710
<v ->Go to, you know, Jimmy John's or something.</v>

70
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.543
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->I mean you should probably</v>

71
00:02:29.543 --> 00:02:32.250
do that first before you go to Subway but that's just me.

72
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.530
But yeah, I guess if you don't have any other choice

73
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.150
then you're stuck in a line for...

74
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.140
<v ->And I think this is also,</v>

75
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.590
I mean 'cause this is a unique situation for either one.

76
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.700
Like you having to wait

77
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.332
in such a long line,-
<v ->That's true-</v>

78
00:02:43.332 --> 00:02:44.165
<v ->so either way,-</v>
<v ->down outside down the block.</v>

79
00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:47.820
<v ->because this is a station, like a subway station,</v>

80
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.910
but I think there's also a connector to get to the airport,

81
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.440
it's called the LAX station,

82
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.150
it is not, the people who are complaining

83
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.010
well it's not close to LAX.

84
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.570
You have to then shuttle over,

85
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.920
so i bet that's what it was about,

86
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.600
like you have to wait in line, whatever.

87
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.700
So I think that was

88
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.112
an understandable-
<v ->Damn,</v>

89
00:03:04.112 --> 00:03:04.945
you really tricked me.
<v ->mistake on your end,</v>

90
00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:06.330
but that was the point, that's why I brought it

91
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.163
it to the table.
<v ->Yeah, you really tricked me.</v>

92
00:03:07.163 --> 00:03:09.690
<v ->Okay, well I have one here,</v>

93
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.690
it's a one star review by Willie and it goes like this.

94
00:03:16.537 --> 00:03:18.390
"When I asked when the next train was leaving,

95
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.803
the guy didn't give me my sandwich." (laughs)

96
00:03:21.803 --> 00:03:22.863
<v ->Are you serious?</v>

97
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:25.890
(Christine laughs)

98
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.840
<v ->End of review.</v>
<v ->Really?</v>

99
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.450
<v ->Yeah.</v>
<v ->That was a real one?</v>

100
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.250
Are you sure you didn't just write that for this?

101
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.500
That's perfect.
<v ->I know. (chuckles)</v>

102
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.907
<v ->Oh my god, when, okay.</v>

103
00:03:36.907 --> 00:03:39.180
"When I asked what time the next train was leaving,-

104
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.470
<v ->The guy- (laughs)</v>
<v ->the guy didn't</v>

105
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.520
give me my sandwich".

106
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.080
Okay, okay, here we go.

107
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.950
I'm gonna break this down,

108
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.170
I'm gonna be very extra with this.

109
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.950
<v ->Okay, great.</v>
<v ->So, hypothetically,</v>

110
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.583
so if this is a Subway sandwich within a train station.

111
00:03:57.518 --> 00:03:58.830
(Alexander sighs)

112
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.250
But why would that person rely on the person

113
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.450
working at Subway to find out when the next train leaves?

114
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.650
I feel like that information

115
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.813
would be readily available most places.

116
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.170
But on the other hand,

117
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.660
if they're asking somebody at the train station,

118
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.660
(both laugh)

119
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.140
if they are at a station and they're reviewing a station,

120
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.230
why would they be getting a sandwich?

121
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.080
<v ->Why does this person have their sandwich-</v>

122
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.130
<v ->Yes.</v>
<v ->in their possession?</v>

123
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.973
<v ->Exactly.</v>

124
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.310
So we gotta go even farther back

125
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.050
to before the sandwich was created.

126
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.883
<v ->Yeah, where did the sandwich...</v>

127
00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:35.832
<v ->From the birth of the sandwich.</v>

128
00:04:35.832 --> 00:04:36.995
<v ->Right.</v>

129
00:04:36.995 --> 00:04:39.843
<v ->This is where it all begins.</v>

130
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.970
I think the only way is if this is some either

131
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.390
maybe it could be a cart, like at a...

132
00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:49.835
(Christine laughs)

133
00:04:49.835 --> 00:04:50.780
Hm...

134
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.530
Or they're on the train and there's the trolley

135
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.490
with sandwiches-

136
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.470
<v ->I like (indistinct).</v>
<v ->asking when they're leaving.</v>

137
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.030
Yeah.

138
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.190
But why wouldn't they just give the sa...

139
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.260
I'm gonna go with Subway sandwich.

140
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.110
<v ->You're correct.</v>
